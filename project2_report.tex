\section{introduction}
Briefly introduce the background & setting of the problem, as well as the aim of the report.
Furthermore, you could give a very short description of the analysis that will be applied.

\section{Data}
The dataset consists of the yield and two measures of bioavailable phosphorous from nine fields.
With one datapoint for each plot, where each field is devided into 4 plots.
The soil was analysed for bioavailable phosphorous with two different methods "Olsen-P" and "DGT".

Include a few good plots to highlight important features in data. You can put additional plots in the appendix.

\section{methods and analysis}

Describe the methods you used and why you decided to use them. 
Also discuss the assumptions behind the methods. Do not go into detail with theory.

\section{results}

Present the results.
Tables and figures are good ways of illustrating results.
What do your results show?
Discuss your results. How reliable are they?

\section{discussion and conclusion}

What are your conclusions? The conclusion should be connected to the aim of the report in the introduction.
	Highight important results
	
If you have found interesting problems/aspects that you haven’t carried out, you can specify them here as ‘future work’.
